## Reflection
[Write 2–4 sentences about what you learned, what worked well, and one challenge you faced.]
I have learned how to use the basic command-lines of git and GitHub using Linux. what worked well was the Linux command lines since all the current classes I'm taking uses Linux. One challenge I faced was creating a repository and committing and pushing my work onto GitHub as someone who is new to using it.
